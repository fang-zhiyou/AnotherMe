1. The contents of folder geolife_dataset folder are trajectory data from 10 users selected from geolife dataset.

2. The contents of folder VTGA folder are trajectory data from 6 users selected from T-driver dataset.

3. In VTGAs folder, the gen_virtual_traj.py and public_api.py show the virtual trajectory generation algorithm of AnotherMe system. To facilitate testing by others, we will separate the algorithm as a standalone component.

4. TrajectoryExp.zip contains the virtual trajectory generation algorithm, such as MN, MLN and ADTGA, and the data mining algorithm, such as LSTM, TSHN and CNN.
